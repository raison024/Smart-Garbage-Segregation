<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<div align="center">
  <img src="images/SmartGarbage.gif" type="gif" alt="png" width="750">
</div>
Image classification for recycling refers to the use of machine
learning algorithms to automatically classify images of waste
materials, such as plastic, paper, and metal, into their respective
categories. This process involves training a model using a large
dataset of labeled images and then using this model to predict the
category of new, unlabeled images. The goal of image classification
for recycling is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of recycling
processes by automating the sorting of materials, reducing human
error, and increasing the amount of recyclable materials that can be
recovered.

### Inspiration <img src="images/inspo.png" alt="png" width="30">
As of 2021, the world generated over 2.01 billion tons of municipal solid waste annually. At least 33% of that waste was not managed in an environmentally safe manner. It is estimated that up to 8 million metric tons of plastic reach the planet’s oceans each year. That equates to five grocery bags filled with plastic for every foot of shoreline on earth. Garbage segregation is a critical issue in modern times due to the rising amount of waste generated by society. Traditional methods of garbage segregation involve manual sorting, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often inefficient. AI/ML can provide a solution to this problem by automating the process of garbage segregation. In this project, we propose a system that utilizes AI/ML algorithms to identify and segregate different types of garbage. The system uses image recognition techniques to analyze the images captured by a camera, and then applies machine learning algorithms to classify the garbage into different categories. The system can also learn from its mistakes and improve its accuracy over time. By automating the process of garbage segregation, we can reduce the workload on human workers, increase efficiency, and reduce environmental pollution.

### Social Impact <img src="images/impact.png" alt="png" width="30">
Image classification for recycling has the potential to create
significant social impact in a number of ways:

1. Environmental sustainability: By automating the sorting of
recyclable materials, image classification can help increase the
recovery of valuable materials and reduce waste. This can help
promote environmental sustainability by conserving resources
and reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with the
production of new materials.
2. Job creation: The implementation of image classification
technology in recycling facilities can create new job
opportunities for individuals with skills in technology and data
analysis. These jobs can help promote economic growth and
provide new career pathways for individuals in the recycling
industry.
3. Education and awareness: Image classification for recycling can
also be used as a tool for education and raising awareness about
the importance of recycling. By creating more efficient and
accurate recycling processes, individuals and communities may
become more engaged in sustainable practices and waste
reduction efforts.
4. Equity and access: Image classification can also help promote
equity and access to recycling services, particularly in
communities that may have limited resources or access to
recycling facilities. By making recycling processes more
efficient, these communities may have greater access to
recycling services and a reduced burden of waste disposal.
Overall, image classification for recycling has the potential to create
significant social impact by promoting environmental sustainability,
job creation, education and awareness, and equity and access.

<!-- Intel one api -->
## Intel oneAPI <img src="images/oneapi2.png" alt="png" width="30">
Intel OneAPI is a comprehensive development platform for building high-performance, cross-architecture applications. It provides a unified programming model, tools, and libraries that allow developers to optimize their applications for Intel CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and other hardware. Intel OneAPI includes support for popular programming languages like C++, Python, and Fortran, as well as frameworks for deep learning, high-performance computing, and data analytics. With Intel OneAPI, developers can build applications that can run on a variety of hardware platforms, from edge devices to data centers, and take advantage of the performance benefits of Intel architectures.

### Use of oneDNN and TensorFlow in our project
<img src="images/onednn.png" alt="png" width="700">
OneDNN provides highly optimized routines for various deep learning operations, including convolution, pooling, normalization, and activation functions. By using oneDNN, you can expect faster execution times and better performance on modern CPUs, especially those with Intel processors.

In this project <code>os.environ['TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS'] = '1'</code> line sets an environment variable called <code>TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS to '1'</code>. This enables the use of Intel's OneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (OneDNN) optimizations for TensorFlow on the system where this code is being run. OneDNN is a high-performance library for deep learning that is designed to optimize the performance of deep neural network computations on a variety of hardware platforms. By enabling OneDNN optimizations, this code may run faster on certain hardware architectures that are compatible with OneDNN. <strong>In this project, the Conv2D and Dense layers will be automatically optimized using oneDNN, which should result in faster training and inference times on compatible hardware.</strong>

The <code>tensorflow.keras</code> module is used to create a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for image classification. The model architecture consists of three convolutional blocks, each followed by a max pooling layer, and three fully connected layers with dropout for regularization.

Finally, the <code>model.compile</code> method is called to configure the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metric for the model. The optimizer used is Adam, and the loss function used is sparse categorical cross-entropy. The model is also evaluated using the accuracy metric.

<!-- What it does -->
## What it does <img src="images/does.png" alt="png" width="30">
The garbage segregation project using AI/ML automates the process of identifying and sorting different types of waste. The system uses image recognition techniques to analyze images captured by a camera and machine learning algorithms to classify the waste into different categories. By accurately identifying and segregating waste, the system can reduce the workload on human workers, increase efficiency, and reduce environmental pollution. The project also promotes responsible waste disposal practices by making people more aware of the types of waste they generate and the proper ways to dispose of them.

✅Data Analysis: In addition to collecting and analyzing data, I gained
experience in data cleaning, data wrangling, and data visualization. These skills
are essential for preparing data for machine learning models and communicating
insights to stakeholders.

✅Environmental Sustainability: By working on a project that promotes waste
reduction and recycling, you likely gained a deeper understanding of the importance of environmental sustainability. This knowledge has motivated me
to explore other ways to reduce waste and promote sustainable practices in your
community.

✅Collaboration: Building a project like this likely required collaboration with a
team of experts in various fields, such as waste management, machine learning,
and data analysis, and I learned the importance of working together to achieve
common goals.

Overall, the skills and knowledge I have gained while building Garbage
Classification for Recycling system are highly valuable and applicable to a wide
range of fields beyond waste management and recycling. Building Garbage
Classification for Recycling was a challenging and rewarding experience .
